# Hey it's me in Dublin!
#### Full Disclosure: I am writing this blog using HTML instead of a pre-made platform like Tumblr, so sorry if it's ugly. 

## *September 2* FIRST POST !

Alright, first update here goes nothing. These first few days have been an absolute whirlwind. I won't go into extreme detail because it's all pretty much anything anyone would expect from the first few days at a new school (lots of orientation, shopping for essentails, learning the public transit etc.) but it's been great so far. Downtown Dublin is crazy fun and everyone is ridiculously nice. Also, our classes don't start until September 10th so we can really do whatever we want until then. I've made a few friends from the IFSA Butler squad but there are also a ton more peopel from Colgate than I was anticipating. There are 7 of us at UCD and 4 at Trinity. Anyway-- I guess I'll jot down some specifics.

### Friday (Aug 31):
Will, Jack, Louisa and our new buddy Hayden all met in the city for dinner and drinks. We started at this place called "The Old Stand." Pretty decent food, very lively atmosphere, nothing to complain about. I got yelled at by an older gentleman for sipping my Guinness before it had completely settled out. But then I yelled at him to wait when he picked his up, and he was totally there for the banter. Good stuff. After that, we went to Hogan's for more drinks, then for 'prinks' at Shannon's Adeleide Square Apartment. Lastly, we went for drinks, live music and dancing with a large crew at G Whelan, until about 2:45am!

### Saturday (Sep 1):
Kinda boring. Orientation most of the day. Sat in a sweet park, not sure what it was called. Hung out with our new friends (James and Kate, from NZ and AUS) for most of the evening and called it early. 

### Sunday (sep 2):
First time being allowed to sleep in ! Took full advantage. I woke up at 11:15 and after a bit of rolling around, I decided to find the gym. Apple Maps took me the long way... I walked 1.3 miles to the gym and then was told once I got there that I hadn't done the online membership survery whatever that I had to do. About a half hour later I was finally granted access to the gym- yay! On the bright side, I found a much faster way back to my room. Post shower, I met up w Jack and we went all over campus and Belfield trying to figure out how to get coins for the bus, because you can't get leap cards (the transit cards) on Sundays! Once in the city, we played pool, ate nachos and drank guinness at Buskers. We then met up w Louisa for drinks at The Exchequer. I had the worst beer I have ever had, called Paulaner München. Can't waste beer though! Then, we made stir fry for dinner in Louisa's apartment. 

Ok. So I realize this is probably super dry for anyone that isn't here. But stick with me-- it's my first try at it.
