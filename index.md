### Thursday (Sep 6): 
UCD Orientation was today so most of what we did is not worth mentioning. After all of that, we went to a welcome reception for international students and learned how to do some traditional irish dances. I still can't dance. At night, there was a €5 pub crawl for international student. Will and I went with our Duke friends and our Aus and Nz crew. We got free Sangria and no cover charges at O'Sheas, MJO'Neills and the Academy (which had free cotton candy at the bar??).

### Wednesday (Sep 5):
Will, Jack and I had big plans to go to the Cliffs of Moher, but after waking up with a bad case of the Irish Flu we decided we'd do something a little less exciting. We hopped on a train to Galway (how cool is it that we can just go anywhere we want without any plans !) and spent the day walking around the city. We ate lunch at The Front Door and walked the Salthill Promenade which was beautiful, lost track of time and almost missed the last train back to Dublin. Sprinting through the city was not the ideal exit strategy but we made it and so now we can look back and laugh! 

### Tuesday (Sep 4):
Will really wanted to go to the National Leprachaun Museum... so we did! It was quite the experience... Not one I'd recommend, but I am glad that we got to do it. After coffee we went back to UCD and had a lazy day before hitting Dicey's for some late night craic. It was Shannon and Fiona's 21st, so we stayed out late to celebrate. Made a lot of new really good friends from Duke. I don't have a lot to talk about from this evening so I'll talk a bit about the roomies!
Jonathan -- 22, getting his Masters in engineering. Beautiful french man. Very sweet, definitely wants to be really good friends with everyone. Caviot -- He barely speaks ANY english. We communicate via google translate for the most part. My 6-11th grade french classes are not helping me out all that much.  
Lesley -- Senior from Chicago studying nursing, super sweet, can definitely see us becoming good friends
Leah -- Hasn't arrived yet. 

### Monday (Sep 3):
Started the day with the Book of Kells at Trinity College. This was really cool, especially the "Long Room" at the end. After leaving there and splurging on some new sunglasses, Will, Jack and I went to Stephen's Green, a beautiful park in the center or Dublin. Unfortunately, hunger got the best of us and we didn't spend a lot of time there. For lunch, we went to the Auld Dubliner, which was one of my favorite bars so far. The locals were having the best of times with the live music, and after listening (and loudly singing along) to a 20 minute early 2000's American Pop medley all to the chords of wonderwall we made our irish exit from the men that we were bopping around with. That evening, we went to Temple Bar which was so much fun and included a lot more live music, The Globe bar, and then finally to Copperface Jacks. The night ended when the club closed-- Another great day in the best city!

### Sunday (Sep 2):
First time being allowed to sleep in ! Took full advantage. I woke up at 11:15 and after a bit of rolling around, I decided to find the gym. Apple Maps took me the long way... I walked 1.3 miles to the gym and then was told once I got there that I hadn't done the online membership survery whatever that I had to do. About a half hour later I was finally granted access to the gym- yay! On the bright side, I found a much faster way back to my room. Post shower, I met up w Jack and we went all over campus and Belfield trying to figure out how to get coins for the bus, because you can't get leap cards (the transit cards) on Sundays! Once in the city, we played pool, ate nachos and drank guinness at Buskers. We then met up w Louisa for drinks at The Exchequer. I had the worst beer I have ever had, called Paulaner München. Can't waste beer though! Then, we made stir fry for dinner in Louisa's apartment. 

Ok. So I realize this is probably super dry for anyone that isn't here. But stick with me-- it's my first try at it. 

### Saturday (Sep 1):
Kinda boring. Orientation most of the day. Sat in a sweet park, not sure what it was called. Hung out with our new friends (James and Kate, from NZ and AUS) for most of the evening and called it early. 

### Friday (Aug 31):
Will, Jack, Louisa and our new buddy Hayden all met in the city for dinner and drinks. We started at this place called "The Old Stand." Pretty decent food, very lively atmosphere, nothing to complain about. I got yelled at by an older gentleman for sipping my Guinness before it had completely settled out. But then I yelled at him to wait when he picked his up, and he was totally there for the banter. Good stuff. After that, we went to Hogan's for more drinks, then for 'prinks' at Shannon's Adeleide Square Apartment. Lastly, we went for drinks, live music and dancing with a large crew at G Whelan, until about 2:45am!

Alright, first update here goes nothing. These first few days have been an absolute whirlwind. I won't go into extreme detail because it's all pretty much anything anyone would expect from the first few days at a new school (lots of orientation, shopping for essentails, learning the public transit etc.) but it's been great so far. Downtown Dublin is crazy fun and everyone is ridiculously nice. Also, our classes don't start until September 10th so we can really do whatever we want until then. I've made a few friends from the IFSA Butler squad but there are also a ton more people from Colgate than I was anticipating. There are 7 of us at UCD and 4 at Trinity. Anyway-- I guess I'll jot down some specifics.
